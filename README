Build a weather app that fetches and displays weather for a given location.
  The User should be able to enter a location into an input field
The User will be presented with temperature, wind speed, likelihood of rain, and general weather i.e. Sunny, Raining, Cloudy etc.
The User will be shown the previous and future 24 hour periods.
The weather outlook can be refreshed by the user.
Stretch Goals
Animation libraries such as framer can used to make the loading of weather more visually appealing
The default weather view is the Users current location.
